[SEED_Features_to_Spectral_Topography_Maps]

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: S. Hwang (sunny16@yonsei.ac.kr)
* Function: This program is a modified program of EEGLearn(Ref) for spectral topography maps generation for SEED dataset(Ref). The 'generate_image.py' produces five dimensional(Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) EEG images(resolution: 32x32). To run this code, you have to prepare the EEG features (PSD, DE, etc.) with 3D coordinates of EEG recording device.
