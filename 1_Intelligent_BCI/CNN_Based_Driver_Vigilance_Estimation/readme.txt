* Function: This program is Convolutional Neural Network based drivers vigilance estimation program. The program include a simple example on SEED-VIG dataset which include 21 subject drivers vigilance value. These codes are composed with CNN-based network, dataset loader, and training scheme. During Training, we evaluate the trained model.
