[Subject_Independent_Emotion_Recognition]

* Programming Language: Python
* Contact: S. Hwang (sunny16@yonsei.ac.kr)
* Function: This program is Convolutional Neural Network based subject independent emotion recognition program. The program include a simple example on SEED dataset which include 15 subject EEG emotional data. These codes are composed with CNN-based network, dataset loader, and test scheme, and we also provide the trained model.

We learned the model as follows:
training: 14 subject from trainset
validation: one subject from trainset
test: all subject testset

day1_val0~14: 0 to 14 is the validation data name in the day1.txt
