<maximum distance of averaged correlation coefficients between two cognitive tasks>

* Programming Language: MATLAB
* Contact: Y.K. Park (shoutme1@korea.ac.kr)
* Function: This algorithm is a feature extraction method for cognitive task classification based on the correlation coefficients of EEG channelpairs by introducing preprocessing of the EEG signals.
We use a adaptive spatial filtering and extract the features that are maximized the distance of averaged correlation coefficients between two task using rotation matrix.
